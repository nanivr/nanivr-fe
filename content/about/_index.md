_nanivr_ through the use of virtual reality headsets allows you to remotely control capable devices - such as drones, underwater boats or cameras - anywhere in the world. Be it New Zealand or the north of Europe.

VR became accessible, requiring no more than semi-modern smartphone and cheap headset adapter, such as [google cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/). _nanivr_ is very elastic though, allowing you to enjoy it on both cheaper (previously mentioned) and more dedicated devices.

Although there are groups of customers which will benefit from nanivr more, like those with limited mobility, we aim to deliver seamless, intuitive experience for everyone.
